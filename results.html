<p><strong>Issue:</strong> Math - Screencastify error</p>
<p><strong>INC Number:</strong> INC0493910</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> MASTERING</p>
<p><strong>Team:</strong> T2</p>
<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> SUPPORT - this is #FAD and the student must remove Screencastify from Chrome by removing the extension. Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution Notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

<p><strong>Resolution Notes:</strong> This is expected behavior in Mastering Platform Update. The original due date for the assignment was September 24th; however, the instructor applied individual student settings to the assignment (I suspect after the student completed it) to give this student a due date October 3rd. Unlike legacy Mastering, Mastering Platform Update does not automatically regrade student submissions when a new due date is applied. For the new settings to apply to the student's submission, the student needs to reopen the assignment. Since the new due date has passed, the instructor will need to push it out to any time in the future, and then the student will need to reopen and save the assignment before the new due date passes.</p>
