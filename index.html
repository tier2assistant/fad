Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p></div>

Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p><p><strong>INC number:</strong> INC0492379</p><p><strong>Opened:</strong> 2024-09-06 21:22:32</p><p><strong>Resolved:</strong> 2024-09-09 13:19:49</p><p><strong>Product Name - Issue short description:</strong> Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</p><p><strong>Assignment group:</strong> Mastering Product Escalations</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> PR_FAD</p><p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Tana Regan</p><p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> Closed</p><p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> This is functioning as designed.

CTS agent should be able to check this with student on call, if further training is needed please advise.</p></div>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p><p><strong>INC number:</strong> INC0492379</p><p><strong>Opened:</strong> 2024-09-06 21:22:32</p><p><strong>Resolved:</strong> 2024-09-09 13:19:49</p><p><strong>Product Name - Issue short description:</strong> Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</p><p><strong>Assignment group:</strong> Mastering Product Escalations</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> PR_FAD</p><p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Tana Regan</p><p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> Closed</p><p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> This is functioning as designed. The box needs to be unchecked each time the instructor manages incompletes: https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm. If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p></div>

We don't provide replacement codes that is something you should be doing.  We also don't provide courses for student's to join that's something their instructor should be doing.  You should also know know how to check to see if they have access to a previous course and inform them once an access code is used it's good for 1 year for any course with the exact same materials.  I am closing this case.  If there is an issue please be specific about what the issue is.  This is FAD.</p></div>

Instructor did not pair LMS course section to MyLab course copy. There is nothing we can assist here.

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

There is nothing we can assist here - if instructor needs help with any of the steps above CTS or Faculty Support can help.</p></div>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p></div>

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p></div>

This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p><p><strong>INC number:</strong> INC0492379</p><p><strong>Opened:</strong> 2024-09-06 21:22:32</p><p><strong>Resolved:</strong> 2024-09-09 13:19:49</p><p><strong>Product Name - Issue short description:</strong> Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</p><p><strong>Assignment group:</strong> Mastering Product Escalations</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> PR_FAD</p><p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Tana Regan</p><p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> Closed</p><p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> This is functioning as designed.

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p></div>

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

I'm not sure why someone didn't try adding the title just as the call to action stated when impersonating the customer.  I as able add the title when impersonating the customer. </p></div>

This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p></div>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p></div>

<div class="result" id="case_N_A"><h3><a name="case_N_A"></a><a href="#case_N_A">Case number: N/A</a></h3><p><strong>Name of agent:</strong> Christopher Bustamante</p><p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Frezalin Bascara</p><p><strong>Team:</strong> T2</p><p><strong>Category:</strong> PEARSON+</p><p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p><p><strong>Case Number:</strong> 50416963</p><p><strong>INC number:</strong> INC0492379</p><p><strong>Opened:</strong> 2024-09-06 21:22:32</p><p><strong>Resolved:</strong> 2024-09-09 13:19:49</p><p><strong>Product Name - Issue short description:</strong> Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</p><p><strong>Assignment group:</strong> Mastering Product Escalations</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> PR_FAD</p><p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Tana Regan</p><p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> Closed</p><p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> This is functioning as designed.

If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p></div>

There is a 100% penalty for late work in the scoring policy. You can see the red dot in the EDU gradebook next to the score for Ch1 and it shows that there was a late submission for the assessment. For Quiz 1.6 I see student submissions from the date Sept 3 all the way through Sept 12. If the student's are claiming to not have a start button they would need to report the issue and make sure the assignment is available to start. The assignments are only set to be available 2 weeks before the due date.</p></div>

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information. As this still has "status" : "RECEIVED", meaning it hasn't been delivered, I checked the gradeSetting collection; which has the sync details, and can see that this is set to automatic, but specific assignments. The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

Please work with the instructor to select the assignments they wish to sync from the instructor dashboard > grade sync tab and then run the manual grade sync.</p></div>

Instructor did not pair LMS course section to MyLab course copy. There is nothing we can assist here.

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

There is nothing we can assist here - if instructor needs help with any of the steps above CTS or Faculty Support can help.</p></div>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p></div>

This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p></div>

Please consult the help available for the features you are using - Here's how I would have solved this case:
After a quick glance at:
https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/import_results.htm
You will see:
"When assignments are similar, you can import only the scores for assignments with the same name and number of points."
Now let's look at the assignments:
Assignments: BA 251 05 Accounting I - Chapter F:2 Dynamic Study Module
# of Points= ?
Chapter F:2 Homework
# of points = ?
Assignments: BA 251 05 - Accounting I Fall 2024 - Chapter F:2 Dynamic Study Module
# of points = ?
Chapter F:2 Homework

Please assist the customer in this #FAD issue. I'd suggest manually entering scores with the updated point values</p><p><strong>Category:</strong> Additional FAD cases</p></div>

You can assist the educator here because there isn't any need to escalate - here's how!

1) have the student enroll in the PREVIOUS section
2) once they have- the EDU can EXPORT the results
3) Once the export is complete have the student enroll in the NEW section

If the COURSES match exactly they can also use the IMPORT options to import the result.

Please assist the educator.</p><p><strong>Category:</strong> Additional FAD cases</p></div>

Please assist the customer with this local technical support issue - if you can not, you may want to refer them to Respondus for support.

Is the student on a chromebook? If not why are they attempting to install the Chrome extension - that is ONLY for students on Chromebooks

If they are not on a Chromebook they need to download the full application using the instructions provided

Please assist the customer - if their Browser/OS isn't supported that doesn't require escalation. That's #FAD - but I can't tell from this case what the issue is at all.

If your course includes questions, such as code questions, with an unlimited number of possible answers, and you select the Unlimited tries option, students can answer the question as many times as they choose.
If, however, you select unlimited tries for assessments with questions that have a set number of answers, Revel limits the tries to the number of answers minus 1, as described above.</p><p><strong>Category:</strong> Additional FAD cases</p></div>

The assignment cannot be deleted because there are results associated with the assignment in the course titled MATH 217 Summer 2024. If these scores have been exported or are no longer needed - you can delete the results for this assignment within this course - and that will allow the full assignment to be removed.

In regards to the Learning Aid changes - these can only be changed on assignments that students have not started. If there are current scores for these assignments - they would need to be deleted as well - the Learning Aids can then be updated - and then students can rework the assignment.

The original due date for the assignment was September 24th; however, the instructor applied individual student settings to the assignment (I suspect after the student completed it) to give this student a due date October 3rd. Unlike legacy Mastering, Mastering Platform Update does not automatically regrade student submissions when a new due date is applied. For the new settings to apply to the student's submission, the student needs to reopen the assignment. Since the new due date has passed, the instructor will need to push it out to any time in the future, and then the student will need to reopen and save the assignment before the new due date passes.</p><p><strong>Category:</strong> Additional FAD cases</p></div>

Now that Auto Grade sync is turned on this should let the grades sync right when they are completed by the student and should also stop these "false" late submissions that are only showing on the Canvas side as the grade is showing up correctly on the Revel side.  Unfortunately to my knowledge there is no way to retroactively fix the Canvas gradebook but that would be a question for the school Canvas admin or Canvas support.  If this is still happening on future assignments that haven't been completed yet  and the grades sync automatically please give us one student and the exercise so that we can look into this.  The Revel and Learning Management System team are aware that submission time aren't sent to the LMS and the sync time is what is view by the Learning Management System as the "submit time" and can cause this issue.  Unfortunately I do not have an ETA on when this will be changed but it is something the teams are working diligently on.</p><p><strong>Missing Info:</strong> #INFO - for grade sync issues, we need specifics; I.E. student and assignment that is marked as late in the LMS. otherwise it is very easy to miss the issue completely.</p><p><strong>Category:</strong> INFO</p></div>

- we would need to try to replicate this so we would need exact steps to replicate. Also a short video from a student having this happen would be helpful

3) Students are completing the quizzes but then a blank screen appears, and they are told they are receiving a 0 out of 21 or however much the quiz was worth.
-We would need a screenshot of what the student is seeing along with the course ID, assignment name, and assessment name.

Please make sure any screenshots are not cropped

There was not a specific assignment title offered in this case. The student shows they have two instructor provided 0's in the gradebook. For both of these assignments - if you review the Item Analysis - you can see the student did not attempt any of the questions within either assignment. When the instructor ran the manage incomplete functionality - the assignment was given a 0.

If the student attempted to work on these after the 0 was provided - it would have been in review mode and nothing would have been logged as the score was already provided.

Thanks

This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p><p><strong>Case Number:</strong> 50416963</p><p><strong>INC number:</strong> INC0492379</p><p><strong>Opened:</strong> 2024-09-06 21:22:32</p><p><strong>Resolved:</strong> 2024-09-09 13:19:49</p><p><strong>Product Name - Issue short description:</strong> Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</p><p><strong>Assignment group:</strong> Mastering Product Escalations</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> PR_FAD</p><p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Tana Regan</p><p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> Closed</p><p><strong>FAD Reason.:</strong> This is functioning as designed.

However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p></div>

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.
